## Samples list

There are two main categories of samples: **Camera** and
**Applications**. The samples in the **Camera** category focus only on
how to use the camera. The samples in the **Applications** category use
the output generated by the camera, such as the 3D point cloud, a 2D
image or other data from the camera. These samples shows how the data
from the camera can be used.

  - **Camera**
      - **Basic**
          - [CaptureHDRCompleteSettings](https://github.com/zivid/zivid-csharp-samples/tree/master//source/Camera/Basic/CaptureHDRCompleteSettings/CaptureHDRCompleteSettings.cs) - Capture point clouds, with color, from the Zivid camera
            with fully configured settings.
          - [CaptureAssistant](https://github.com/zivid/zivid-csharp-samples/tree/master//source/Camera/Basic/CaptureAssistant/CaptureAssistant.cs) - Use Capture Assistant to capture point clouds, with color,
            from the Zivid camera.

            time and capture cycle.
          - [CaptureWithDiagnostics](https://github.com/zivid/zivid-csharp-samples/tree/master//source/Camera/InfoUtilOther/CaptureWithDiagnostics/CaptureWithDiagnostics.cs) - Capture point clouds, with color, from the Zivid camera,
            with settings from YML file and diagnostics enabled.
          - [PrintVersionInfo](https://github.com/zivid/zivid-csharp-samples/tree/master//source/Camera/InfoUtilOther/PrintVersionInfo/PrintVersionInfo.cs) - List connected cameras and print version information.

    Data](https://support.zivid.com/latest//api-reference/samples/sample-data.html)

Launch the Command Prompt by pressing `Win` + `R` keys on the keyboard,
then type `cmd` and press `Enter`.

Navigate to a location where you want to clone the repository, then run
to following command:

``` sourceCode 
git clone https://github.com/zivid/zivid-csharp-samples
```

Open ZividNETSamples.sln in Visual Studio, build it and run it. If you
are uncertain about doing this, check out [Build C\# Samples using
Visual
Studio](https://support.zivid.com/latest/rst/api-reference/samples/csharp/build-c-sharp-samples-using-visual-studio.html).

Some of the samples depend on external libraries, in particular
`YamlDotNet` and `MathNet.Numerics`. These libraries will be installed
automatically through NuGet when building the sample.
